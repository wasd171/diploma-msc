\section{Support of the \texttt{REPLYTO} command}
\label{sec:replyto}

\textit{Components affected}: \textbf{COM Handler} (\ref{sec:com_handler})

\textit{Motivation}: in order to create a truly interconnected DAQ system it is not enough to be able to send SCPI commands to our nodes. We also need to be able to use their responses for a feedback loop of any kind. 

\textit{Requirements}: this feature completes the feature \ref{sec:request}
