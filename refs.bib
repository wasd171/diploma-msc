abstract = {The theory of the expanding universe, which presupposes a superdense initial state of matter, apparently excludes the possibility of the macroscopic separation of matter from antimatter; it must therefore be assumed that there are no antimatter bodies in nature, i.e., the universe is asymmetrical with respect to the number of particles and antiparticles (C asymmetry). In particular, the absence of antibaryons and the proposed absence of baryonic neutrinos implies a nonzero baryon charge (baryonic asymmetry). We wish to point out a possible explanation of C asymmetry in the hot model of the expanding universe [1] by making use of the effects of CP invariance violation [2]. To explain baryon asymmetry, we propose in addition an approximate character for the baryon conservation law.},

@article{Dubbers2011,
abstract = {Experiments with cold and ultracold neutrons have reached a level of precision such that problems far beyond the scale of the present standard model of particle physics become accessible to experimental investigation. Because of the close links between particle physics and cosmology, these studies also permit a deep look into the very first instances of our Universe. First addressed in this article, in both theory and experiment, is the problem of baryogenesis, the mechanism behind the evident dominance of matter over antimatter in the Universe. The question of how baryogenesis could have happened is open to experimental tests, and it turns out that this problem can be curbed by the very stringent limits on an electric dipole moment of the neutron, a quantity that also has deep implications for particle physics. Then the recent spectacular observation of neutron quantization in the Earth's gravitational field and of resonance transitions between such gravitational energy states is discussed. These measurements, together with new evaluations of neutron scattering data, set new constraints on deviations from Newton's gravitational law at the picometer scale. Such deviations are predicted in modern theories with extra dimensions that propose unification of the Planck scale with the scale of the standard model. These experiments start closing the remaining "axion window" on new spin-dependent forces in the submillimeter range. Another main topic is the weak-interaction parameters in various fields of physics and astrophysics that must all be derived from measured neutron-decay data. Up until now, about 10 different neutron-decay observables have been measured, much more than needed in the electroweak standard model. This allows various precise tests for new physics beyond the standard model, competing with or surpassing similar tests at high energy. The review ends with a discussion of neutron and nuclear data required in the synthesis of the elements during the "first three minutes" and later on in stellar nucleosynthesis. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

@article{Golub1994,
abstract = {A brief review of the history of the experimental search for the neutron electric-dipole moment (EDM) is presented, followed by a discussion of the "state of the art" experimental techniques based on the storage of ultracold neutrons. Also discussed is the recent work on the construction of an improved experiment incorporating a 199Hg magnetometer within the ultracold neutron storage volume. We then review a number of well-known experimental and theoretical results and propose an entirely new experimental technique to search for the neutron EDM based on storing together, in superfluid 4He, polarized ultracold neutrons and a polarized gas of 3He atoms; this forms a unique system of two spins interacting by means of a spin-dependent mutual absorption. Such a system appears to be ideally suited for use in a neutron EDM search. Following a brief description of the method, we present an analysis of the dynamics of such a system and calculate the statistical uncertainties to be expected in an EDM search. We show that, in principle, improvement by a factor of over 1000 in the experimental limit is possible. This limit would be more than sufficient to determine whether the known CP violation leads to the observed cosmological baryon asymmetry and, in addition, would set very strict limits on the supersymmetric, multi-Higgs, and left-right-symmetric models of CP violation. We conclude with a discussion of some technical questions related to the proposed experimental technique. {\textcopyright} 1994.},
